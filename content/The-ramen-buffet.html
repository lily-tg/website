                    <p>Kevin and Stuart were two boys who couldn't manage to get a girl for Valentine's day. After school, they started walking down the street when they saw a ramen shop. Today there was an all-you-can-eat buffet special for single girls because of the holiday. Unfortunately, there wasn't a similar offer for boys.</p>
                    <p>Stuart suddenly had a brilliant idea. Using some sex-change pills he had adquiered in the dark web (don't ask why he had them) they could become girls for a day and enjoy a lot of ramen from the limited time offer. After thinking of new names and buying some clothes, they were finally ready to eat.</p>
                    <p>When they arrived, they asked to participate in the buffet and were easily able to get their hands on the food. Stacy was happily enjoying the ramen when she said: "See, Kelly? This was a great idea. We won't have to pay that much for the food." Kelly just continued eating, but then she thought: "The ramen was really cheap before. This was totally unnecesary."</p>
