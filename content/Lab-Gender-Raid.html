                    <p>Ember was a simple man with his own goals. One day, he got kidnapped and taken into a lab. There, he was injected a wierd substance wich changed his sex.</p>
                    <p>He tried fighting back, but in the process got stabbed in the eye. It was so painful, he passed out. When he woke up, she was still processing what happened. She then overheard a plan to do something to her.</p>
                    <p>Before anything could happen, an explotion appeared in the distance. A group of thieves raid the lab and found her. She was rescued and taken care of for until her recovery.</p>
                    <p>As it turns out, the transformation couldn't be reversed. Five years later, she now lives as Amber, and uses her long hair to hide her scar in order to look better. She still has sight problems because of her poor depth perception.</p>
