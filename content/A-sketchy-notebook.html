                <div class="text-holder">
                    <p>Kevin liked drawing people in his notebook, he did it as practice to improve his skills. One day, he realized he had used up every page, which meant there was no more space to draw.</p>
                    <p>He searched for a new notebook in order to continue his drawings, but he couldn't find anything at first. After about an hour, however, he finally suceeded. The new notebook had some sketchy vibe to it, but he was now inspired to work.</p>
                    <p>He started with a simple outline of a beautiful girl. As the drawing continued; he started adding more details, like the glow in the eyes, the flow of the hair, and so on. Unbeknownst to him, he was starting to change into the girl he was drawing.</p>
                    <p>By the time he had finished the picture, it looked just like herself. Kim admired her drawing skills and decided to take a break.</p>
