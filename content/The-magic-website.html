                    <p>There was a rumor about a website that allowed people to modify their bodies like a character customization screen. Marco was feeling curious about what could be done with it, but didn't fully believe it was real. One day, after a long investigation, he found a link. The website warned against any possible interruption, in order to improve the user experience.</p>
                    <p>Marco started with something simple, so he just selected a longer hairstyle. At that moment, his hair extended out to the specified lenght. After observing the change in real time, he modified other things, like his eyes, clothes, and even gender. She checked out the name section and decided her name would be Marcie, since she was now a girl.</p>
                    <p>She took a look at her body in the mirror and thought she looked cute. After trying different styles, she decided to change back. However, before she could do that, there was a blackout at the city, which caused her computer to turn off. Marcie would be stuck like this until she could go back to the website.</p>
