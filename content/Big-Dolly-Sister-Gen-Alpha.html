                <div class="text-holder">
                    <p>Halloween was fast approaching and two siblings were arguing about their costumes. The younger sister, Molly, was a big fan of The Amazing Digital Circus, so she went to dress as Pomni, since in her opinion, she's has good vibes in the series. The older brother, Matt, didn't have a plan for the holiday, but his sister thought that was sus and insisted him further.</p>
                    <p>At night, Molly went out to explore the town and found a stiched dress with a red wig and a big bow. She urged Matt to try it on saying it would be lit. Reluctantly he accepted, not wanting to be called cringe for a millionth time. But when he dressed up, some reallly Ohio stuff happened.</p>
                    <p>Matt's skin started to take on a ragged texture. He tried taking off the wig, but it wouldn't budge anymore. He started growing rapidly, both in height and in body proportions. Once he, or rather she, was starting to process her changes, a big button started to grow on her right eye, but surprisingly, it didn't feel painful. It was a really skidi experience.</p>
                    <p>Once the changes were done, Molly stared at her, amazed at the sudden glow-up. She decided to hug her now big sister who now looked like Ragatha. After some discussion, they went treat or treating together and proceed to get a lot of candy. It helped that Matt liked her new body, since she kinda looked fire, no cap.</p>
