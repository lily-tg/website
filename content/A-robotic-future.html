                    <p>In a far future, technology advanced enough for it to be possible to put someone's mind inside a machine. All of this was done in order to extend the human lifespan.</p>
                    <p>Federic was some guy who recently got enough money to get a robotic body. After paying up, he was given a tablet to customize it as he wanted. Once finished, he went to a special room to finish his robotic conversion.</p>
                    <p>Along the way, he crashed with someone else and apologized. Continuing on his way, he found the conversion room not too far away. After arriving and signing a contract, he was put into a deep sleep.</p>
                    <p>When he woke up, he was told there had been a mistake and given some money for compensation. Apparently, he and another person swapped their tablets. It would take a while to fix the problem. Meanwhile, he would have to celebrate the year in a female body.</p>
