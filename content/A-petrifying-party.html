                    <p>Nick and Kim were good friends who were preparing for a halloween party. One of their classmates had prepared special potions that could change people's appereance into any person, character or mythological creature.</p>
                    <p>The effects would be reversed by the end of the night, so it wouldn't be a big deal. Everyone would have the perfect costume for the party. When Nick drank the potion, his appearance changed into Téa Gardner, a competent player of card battles. He was enjoying himself, but it didn't last long.</p>
                    <p>When Kim drank the potion, her appereance changed into Medusa. It was the last of the cauldron, so it's effect was stronger than ususal, giving her an actual pertifying gaze, which Nick just happened to look at. Nick was now a statue of Téa Gardner, and couldn't participate in the other activities.</p>
                    <p>He was aware of everything going on in the party, but he couldn't move at all. The other classmates saw him on display and started taking fotos of 'the cool halloween decoration'. When the party ended, he was still a statue. He's now stuck in the backyard until someone figures a way to turn him back.</p>
