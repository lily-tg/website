                    <p>Albert was in love with one of his classmates at school, named Madison. She was cute, smart and her hair flowed nicely. Unfortunately, he was never able to start a relationship with her as he wasn't her type. One day, he wished on a shooting star to be attractive enough for his crush.</p>
                    <p>When he woke up, he noticed two orbs hanging on his chest. After examining the room and checking a mirror, Albert realized he had turned into a girl.</p>
                    <p>Albertine opened her closet and picked a cute outfit. At school, she was getting used to her new situation. After classes, she went to the park and found a familiar classmate.</p>
                    <p>Madison turned around and saw Albertine walking towards her. After buying some food, they started talking about life, fashion and sweets. A few months later, Albertine asked her crush out, at least for Valentine's day.</p>
                    <p>"Madison, you're so cute. Would you like to be my Valentine's?"</p>
                    <p>"Of course, my dear Albertine."</p>
