                    <p>Tim was a small child who wanted to be a girl, but he hadn't figured it out yet. One day, when no one was at home, he snuck into his sister's room. She was named Sophie and was only slightly older than him, so he was able to try on her clothes.</p>
                    <p>While playing around in the mirror, suddenly, his sister arrived. It was an ankward moment for the siblings. Eventually, Sophie proposed he should have his own dresses if he liked them so much.</p>
                    <p>So here he was, getting a dress in Christmas, along with other stuff. He was even allowed to grow his hair if he wanted to. At this point he was starting to consider the possibility of being a girl, but he still hadn't thought of a new name.</p>
                    <p>Whatever happened next, he knew Sophie and their parents would support him along the way.</p>
