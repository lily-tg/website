                    <p>A little boy was bored around Halloween time in a small town. Since he wasn't able to find a costume in time, he went exploring a nearby forest to spend the day. In the middle of the trip, he found a seemingly abandoned castle, with the words "Halloween House" written on it. After pondering for a while, he decided to go inside.</p>
                    <p>Once inside, he started walking down the hallways, when unexpectedly, everything got dark. In that moment he heard a few voices, but he didn't know where they were coming from.</p>
                    <p>"Queen, is that you?"</p>
                    <p>"You finally returned!"</p>
                    <p>"It's time for a makeover."</p>
                    <p>Suddenly, some ghosts appeared out of nowhere and took him to an isolated room. His clothes were changing into an orange, poofy dress. Meanwhile, his skin was turning more pale as he slowly morphed into a girl. They gave her an authum themed crown, and memories started coming to her.</p>
                    <p>After the makeover was done, the queen woke up. She thanked the ghosts for helping her return from her slumber. They explained to her that the castle got abandoned a few decades ago after people around the world stopped celebrating Halloween. Her previous memories started to fade away as she brainstormed plans to return the holiday to it's former glory.</p>
