                    <p>Luis had been bored with life for quite some time. One day, while watching TV, he recieved an unknown package. Upon further inspection, it was a bubblegum box. Inside was written the phrase: "Blow your problems into a new life".</p>
                    <p>Since he had nothing better to do, he started chewing the gum. After a while, he was ready to make a bubble. As the bubble got bigger, his skin got smoother, his hips went wider and his hair grew longer. However, right after his privates inverted themselves, the bubble blew out.</p>
                    <p>At this point, Lucia had an idea. She checked the closet and found a guitar she hadn't used in a while. She tied her hair into a ponytail and got new clothes for herself. She brought her instrument to a studio and got ready to practice.</p>
                    <p>Deciding she liked the gum's flavor, she took more of it with her and started blowing another bubble. Maybe one day she could form a band, but first, she needed to improve her skills.</p>
