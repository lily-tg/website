                    <p>A boy named Charlie had heard a lot about Christmas. He knew an old man named Santa delivered presents to everyone each year. Recently, he started to question if they were real or not, so he traveled across the town in search of an answer.</p>
                    <p>He eventually found an old building labeled "Santa's Workshop". Walking inside, it was seemingly empty, with the exception of a wand on a table. Apparently someone had left it there.</p>
                    <p>Feeling curious, he did a circular motion at the floor, which got turned into ice. Suddenly, he heard a scream of pain. He saw an old man he recognized as Santa, who was severly hurt over slipping on the ground.</p>
                    <p>One of the elves went to investigate the noise and realized what had happened. After asking for her wand back, she explained: "Unfortunately, Santa won't be able to deliver the presents this year because of his injuries.". She then said to Charlie: "You know? What about you take his place, considering you caused this?".</p>
                    <p>She motioned her wand at Charlie, and suddenly, he became a girl. Charlie, now Chloe, asked: "Why am I a girl now?". The elf mentioned how she wanted to have fun despite the fact she had to help her deliver the presents. "Also, there is a girl who doesn't believe in Santa. Could you please convince her he exists? Thank you!", she said exhausted.</p>
                    <p>And so, the duo started getting ready to save Christmas, at least for this year.</p>
