                    <p>Zack was very excited to participate in this year's halloween. He disguised himself as a zombie because it was an easy to make disguise, and it wouldn't take too much time. He went to people's houses asking for candy until he found a mysterious building. There seemed to be no one inside, so he entered the place.</p>
                    <p>Inside, there was a book with a mystic vibe. Curious, he checked some pages until he found an interesting sounding spell. He chanted it with all his heart to see what would happen, unfortunately, he went unconcious.</p>
                    <p>When he woke up, he was a little disoriented. His skin felt wierd and rotten, like it wasn't alive. After finding a mirror, he realized she had transformed into a cute zombie-like girl.</p>
                    <p>Checking the room revealed two large swords that could be useful for fighting. She would go by the name of Zarah while she figured out how to undo the spell, or at least, go back to being a human. For the moment, she would like to learn the art of the katana.</p>
