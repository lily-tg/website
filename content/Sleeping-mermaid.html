                    <p>There was a boy named Oscar, who liked going to the beach to relax when he got too stressed from life. He prefered going out at night, when not a lot of people visit the area. On one such ocassion, he felt curiosity to see the ocean.</p>
                    <p>After swimming deep into the ocean, he found interesting sights, such as coral reefs, varying aquatic life forms, and remains of an underwater civilization. Being a human meant he had to go back to the surface to breath a little and continue exploring later.</p>
                    <p>Each day, he was getting more curious to know what he had missed in the sea. One dight, during a full moon, he checked out the underwater ruins and found an orange, circular orb, carefully positioned at the top of a pillar.</p>
                    <p>He tried taking it back home as a souvenir, but upon reaching the surface it started to shine, enveloping him in a strange light and triggering a transformation. His skin softened, his hair grew, and his chest expanded a little. He barely had time to process what was happening to her as her legs fused into a fin and she started to feel tired.</p>
                    <p>As a mermaid, she could figure out was going on later, but first, she needed to find a good place to sleep.</p>
