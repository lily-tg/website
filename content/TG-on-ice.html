                    <p>Sam was a small child who got bored easily. Since he didn't have anything to do at home, his mother decided to search for activities outside. One day, she found a place where people could train ice skating, so she decided he could give it a try.</p>
                    <p>At first, he was frustrated. He couldn't skate well and falled quite often because he didn't understand the basic techniques. However, over time he started to get better. With help from the teacher, he was able to learn the basics and continue practicing. As he continued to train, he noticed his hair had gotten a little longer, but didn't think much about it.</p>
                    <p>As he improved, his hair got longer, his eyebrows expanded and his outfit got more femenine. One day he looked at the mirror to see a cute and small girl in the other side. "How did this happen?", she thought for a moment, but eventually she settled into "At least I'm cute.". She went outside and felt ready to start some intermidiate ice-skating techniques.</p>
