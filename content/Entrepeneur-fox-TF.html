                    <p>Katubbus was having a decently normal day, enjoying her peaceful life in the world. Today was a relaxing day, where she could finally have a break to unwind herself. However, she drank a lot of water earlier and felt an urge to go to the bathroom to relieve herself.</p>
                    <p>Once inside, after doing her necessities, she observed the mirror and noticed a cigarette that wasn't there before. 'How unusual', she thought. Out of curiosity, she takes it. Before she could do anything, it started to glow ominously.</p>
                    <p>First, her fur started slowly changing color from light green to a more reddish orange. Her clothes morphed themselves into a white robe and a black skirt. She wouldn't notice, but the environment was being affected by the transformation.</p>
                    <p>She opened a closet and found some golden chains, a few earrings and a classy red jacket. As thoughts about high class life started entering her mind, her mobile phone became a pack of cigarettes, the trans flag decorating her room was now a snapshot of the stock market. Everything started looking more like a rich CEO's room. Even her bed became more high end.</p>
                    <p>Before going outside to check her company's stock, she decided to look at herself in the bathroom mirror. Maybe she would smoke a little more. After all, she didn't need to go to the office just now, unlike the peasants who worked for her. She no longer remembered who she was before.</p>
