                    <p>Sam was a nice man who worked at a small tech company. In his free time, he helped out other people, so he was known as a morally good and respectable person.</p>
                    <p>One day, a fairy, passing by, saw his great altruism and decided he would be better at helping people if he was a woman, so she used her magical powers and changed him, not knowing the full implications of what she was about to do.</p>
                    <p>When Sam woke up, he felt there was something unusual. Once he got a look in the mirror, she realized just how different she was now. The next day, she stayed home, trying to convince herself it was just a strange dream.</p>
                    <p>After finally going outside, she tried to get back to her job, but no one recognized her and she was eventually removed from the building. Money was starting to run out, so she tried filling for unemployment, but her ID no longer matched with her new situation.</p>
                    <p>She was considering giving up, when she suddenly found a gun. Luckily for her, there seems to be a bank nearby.</p>
