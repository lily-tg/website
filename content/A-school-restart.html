                    <p>Nick was a recent collage graduate who had trouble searching for a new job, since his career wasn't very appreciated in society. One day, he was walking through the streets when he saw a wishing well. He didn't believe that much in them, but it didn't hurt to try.</p>
                    <p>He wished to go through school again, so he could choose a different career, and then slipped a coin inside. At first, nothing seemed to happen, but as he started to walk back home, everything started to change.</p>
                    <p>First, he started to get shorter. Then, his chest expanded, his skin softened and his genitals inverted. His clothes changed into a school uniform with a skirt in it. The wind blew, showing his, or rather, her now long hair.</p>
                    <p>The girl stopped walking and started to notice the changes. The name 'Nikki' came to mind as she conviniently found her school supplies at home. She would have to make a good first impression this year.</p>
