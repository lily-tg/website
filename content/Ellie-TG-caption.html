                    <p>Paul was bored and decided to explore an abandoned building. When he got there, he saw the usual: broken windows, nature regrowing, and a general state of disrepair.</p>
                    <p>While inspecting the place, he found a wierd floating skull with heart shaped eyes, so he decided to inspect it. Suddenly, it jumped into his shirt. When he tried to take it off, it used some magic on him.</p>
                    <p>His growing hair blocked his vision for a moment. After moving it out of the way, he started to feel some weight on his chest. Upon further exploration, he realized she had turned into a girl. The name "Ellie" came to mind as memories she didn't experience started growing in her head.</p>
                    <p>Ellie made a pose, admiring her new outfit. The skull really made it a cooler blouse. She decided to take a selfie and search for Phoenix in order to have another date.</p>
