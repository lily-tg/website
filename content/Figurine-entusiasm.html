                    <p>Edward was an otaku, a big fan of anime. So, once he heard online of a figurine sale, he knew he had to get it as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>After making sure he had enough money, he made his trip to the shop. When he arrived, there was only one figurine left, so he bought it quickly before anyone else could. In the line, an old woman looked at him suspiciously and chanted some strange words, but he didn't understand anything of it.</p>
                    <p>At home, Edward opened the package and started admiring his newest figurine. As he analized it, his hair grew longer, his skin became softer and he started growing breasts. After fully becoming a girl, her clothes changed to a white t-shirt and a blue skirt.</p>
                    <p>She's now Emily, a cute girl who still likes anime, but recently she started to get an interest in cosplaying. Maybe one day, she'll match the look of her favorite character.</p>
